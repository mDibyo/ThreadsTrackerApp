ThreadsTracker

- Keep record of activities
- Assign different level of priorities

Implementation
- Visualize as a _deck_ of cards
- Each card is a transparent table on which a single day's events are displayed
- Go in to move to the next day, go out to move back a day
- Zoom out to lay cards in a surface: the month

- Cards colored to show different spheres of life (eg. Social, Business, Commitments, Urgent), size of each area proportional to time to be given
